# Fetch-Image
Move images from a folder to another.

As you probably can see (if you've checked the code) I made this for skyrim, 'cause when you take screenshots in the game it saves the pictures inside of the games directory with the exe files and such. I couldnt see any option to change the output directory, I also googled and people also said it couldnt be done normally.

So I took the challenge I thought I easily could do and it went all fine. The most challenging part for me was to run it in a nice way. I tried clicking on the .py file and that didnlt run it. I could do it by shortcut "windows key" + R and type fetch but I wanted it in another way.

I found pyinstaller and found out how to use it after a little while.
So now I have a shortcut to the fetch.exe inside of the "output" folder, which works as I want it :)
